Freddie is very laid back and has a very calm and gentle personality.  He will often leave his feeding early to come over for some one-on-one time with the volunteers and proceeds to purr his heart out with all the attention.   </p>

In spite of her living conditions, Chin is always meticulously clean.  This once shy girl is now super friendly and always one of the first to greet people as they come to feed and often prefers petting to eating!   </p>

                                    Tommie) is definitely the Cat in Charge and the one with the biggest personality.  When we first met Tommie (and before he was neutered) none of us thought he was adoptable.  Over time and since he was neutered, he has undergone a complete transformation! He’s still the leader of the pack, but he has now turned into Mr. Friendly, and instead of running away is now first in line to be petted.  With beautiful light green eyes, and fantastic markings he is a cat ready for a new home.
